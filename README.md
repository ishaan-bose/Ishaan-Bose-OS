# Ishaan-Bose-OS
My Very own Operating System

# What to do
You should download qemu-system-i386 with the following command:
```sudo apt-get install qemu-system-i386```
this will take about 3-5 minutes to install

Download the nasm assembler with ``` sudo apt install nasm ```

# Contributing
always run on a virtual machine

# Running the operating system
run this command: ```cd code/``` then run this command:
```./build.sh```
  
this will (or at least should) print out the following
```            v~~~ the hello world ate some of the other text     
hello worldea  ion 1.13.0-1ubuntu1)

iPXE (http://ipxe.org) 00:03.0 and some text that is too long to type

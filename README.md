# Ishaan-Bose-OS
My Very own Operating System

# What to do
You should download qemu-system-i386 with the following command:
```sudo apt-get install qemu-system-i386```
this will take about 3-5 minutes to install

Download the nasm assembler with ''' sudo apt install nasm '''

  # Running the operating system
  run this command: ```cd code/``` then run this command:
  ```./build.sh```
  
  this will (or at least should) print out the following
  ``` 
  YeaBios (version 1.13.0-1ubuntu1)
  
  iPXE (http://ipxe.org) 00:03.0 and some text that is too long to type
  
  Booting from ROM...

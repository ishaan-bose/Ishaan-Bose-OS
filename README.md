So you want to build an operating system from scratch, then this is(maybe) the right place.
Is this a complete waste of time? probably.
My Very own Operating System

# What to do
You should download qemu-system-i386 with the following command:
```sudo apt-get install qemu-system-i386```
this will take about 3-5 minutes to install

Download the nasm assembler with ``` sudo apt install nasm ```

# Contributing
always run on a virtual machine
read CONTRIBUTING.md

# Running the operating system
run this command: ```cd code/``` then run this command:
```./build.sh```
  
this will (or at least should) print out the following
```     
hello world
```
